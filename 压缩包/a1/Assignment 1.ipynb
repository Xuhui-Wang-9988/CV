        "# Computer Vision 2022 Assignment 1: Image filtering\n",
        "\n",
        "In this prac you will research, implement and test some image filtering operations. Image filtering by convolution is a fundamental step in many computer vision tasks and you will find it useful to have a firm grasp of how it works. For example, later in the course we will come across Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are built from convolutional image filters.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main aims of the prac are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- to understand the basics of how images are stored and processed in memory;\n",
        "- to gain exposure to several common image filters, and understand how they work;\n",
        "- to get practical experience implementing convolutional image filters;\n",
        "- to test your intuition about image filtering by running some experiments;\n",
        "- to report your results in a clear and concise manner.\n",
